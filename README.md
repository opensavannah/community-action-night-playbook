>*Note: Out of consideration to the volunteerism of the Core Team, you may want to limit text messages to Core Team members regarding brigade matters to an as-needed basis, unless you're contacting the fellow team member in a social context, or if the individual has stated that they prefer SMS to communicate (like me!)*

## A.) PRE-EVENT PREPARATIONS FOR COMMUNITY ACTION NIGHTS (CANs!)  üë©üèΩ‚Äçüöí
 üìÖ* REGULARLY-SCHEDULED **CANs** TAKE PLACE EVERY 2nd AND 4th WEDNESDAYS OF EACH MONTH AT 6:30 p.m.* üìÖü•á&ü•â

			<--REDACTED-->	

+ **~5:15 p.m.** üïê  Designated event organizer (typically the Brigade Captain) arrives at [Bull Street Labs](http://bullstreetlabs.com) (or *elsewhere*, as we should begin doing for purposes of *meeting people where they are*). 
+ **5:30 p.m. sharp** - Check [Meetup](http://meetup.com/opensavannah) and, if applicable, any Facebook events for the evening to get an estimated head-count of predicted attendees. Take into account any unplanned factors that may influence the count, such as bad weather that would depress turnout or the last-minute announcement of an event with a lot of community interest that would boost turnout.
