## A.) PRE-EVENT PREPARATIONS FOR COMMUNITY ACTION NIGHTS (CANs!)  üë©üèΩ‚Äçüöí
 üìÖ* REGULARLY-SCHEDULED **CANs** TAKE PLACE EVERY 1st AND 3rd WEDNESDAYS OF EACH MONTH AT 6:30 p.m.* üìÖü•á&ü•â

### On the day of each CAN, the designated event host will follow roughly the following schedule of tasks:

+ **BEFORE 12:00 NOON**: Send a reminder email the morning of each CAN to remind our mailing list subscribers to RSVP before 5 p.m. 
	>	To do this, log in to the Open Savannah Mailchimp Account with the following credentials:

		<--redacted-->

+ **~5:15 p.m.** üïê  Designated event organizer (typically the Brigade Captain) arrives at [Bull Street Labs](http://bullstreetlabs.com) (or *elsewhere*, as we should begin doing for purposes of *meeting people where they are*). 
+ **5:30 p.m. sharp** - Check [Meetup](http://meetup.com/opensavannah) and, if applicable, any Facebook events for the evening to get an estimated head-count of predicted attendees. Take into account any unplanned factors that may influence the count, such as bad weather that would depress turnout or the last-minute announcement of an event with a lot of community interest that would boost turnout.

	+ Once you have an estimated attendance count, use üçï [howmanypizzasdoineed.com](http://howmanypizzasdoineed.com) or just guesstimate in your head, then call Green Fire pizza on Drayton Street 

+ **6:05 p.m.** - Locate the blank `Hi, My name is ___` nametags in the OS office, and grab at least two (2) sharpies. Also bring out the sticker basket and the sign-in sheet from Coco's office. Place these items at the entrance and assign a volunteer to man the station. **MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE SIGNS IN AND HAS A NAMETAG.** No exceptions. Not even Rob Lingle (well, maybe if you're Taylor Swift, that's it). 
 
+ **6:15 p.m.** Use the bluetooth speaker in the OS office to turn on some background üéµ music. This helps lessen awkward silence.

+ **6:20 p.m.** - Look at the current project list, which will be sent out by the Brigade Captain via email no later than 24 hours prior to the event's start. For each project, take a sharpie and an 8.5x11" sheet of paper from the OS office, write down the name of the project and tape it on a table. If possible, spread tables out as much as possible.

# B. Community Action Night Begins

+ **6:30 p.m.** Assuming the pizza üçï has arrived in a timely fashion, invite everyone to dig in. Give 10-15 min. for attendees to mingle and eat. At this point, have attendees sit at whatever table they wish.

+ **6:45 p.m.** We give the 'Welcome to Open Savannah Community Action Night' 3-minute chat
	+ We circle the room for everyone to introduce themselves, briefly explain what interests them in coming to join, and then to name their favorite thing about Savannah.
	+ We ask newcomers to raise their hands. A second volunteer takes newcomers into the 'green room' (map room) for a 10-15 min. "Civic Tech and Open Savannah 101" session that encapsulates our mission, vision, operating principles, and core beliefs.
	+ For those who know the drill already,
